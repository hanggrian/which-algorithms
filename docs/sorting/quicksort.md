Case | Time complexity | Space complexity
--- | :---: | :---:
Best | $\color{black} \fcolorbox{darkorange}{sandybrown} {Ω(n . log(n))}$
Average | $\color{black} \fcolorbox{darkorange}{sandybrown} {Θ(n . log(n))}$
Worst | $\color{white} \fcolorbox{crimson}{firebrick} {O(n^2)}$ | $\color{black} \fcolorbox{yellowgreen}{greenyellow} {O(log(n))}$

Expands on merge sort with a pivot to reduce the number of comparisons.
