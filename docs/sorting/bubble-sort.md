    &ldquo;**Simplicity** is hard to build, easy to use, and hard to charge for.
    **Complexity** is easy to build, hard to use, and easy to charge for.&rdquo;

Case | Time complexity | Space complexity
--- | :---: | :---:
Best | $\color{black} \fcolorbox{gold}{yellow} {Ω(n)}$
Average | $\color{white} \fcolorbox{crimson}{firebrick} {Θ(n^2)}$
Worst | $\color{white} \fcolorbox{crimson}{firebrick} {O(n^2)}$ | $\color{white} \fcolorbox{limegreen}{forestgreen} {O(1)}$

Bubble sort or sinking sort, is better than selection sort but more complex than
insertion sort.
